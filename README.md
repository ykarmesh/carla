Building CARLA
--------------

Use `git clone` or download the project from this page. Note that the master
branch contains the latest fixes and features, for the latest stable code may be
best to switch to the `stable` branch.

Then follow the instruction at [How to build on Linux][buildlinuxlink] or
[How to build on Windows][buildwindowslink].

Unfortunately we don't have official instructions to build on Mac yet, please
check the progress at [issue #150][issue150].
